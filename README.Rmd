Welcome to my code repository, most or all of it I've learned in a very inclusive sense of the word (including copy from internet forums), following this beautiful logic of public domain I've made these notes available, the idea it's to have a server-independent repository, a repository on the cloud, or should I say, on the bottom of the ocean with several copies in several sites of the world, for today and maybe, just maybe, even available on a post-global disaster era, available physically but not online `r emo::ji("surprise")`. 

I will try to indicate here the structure of all the folders of this repository with links for instance to where the same code is used but in different projects (all of which would be on bioinformatics next-generation data analysis.). As an example a very basic but useful code I wrote in bash syntax take a given list (better a SRA table from NCBI SRA Data repository) and download it discriminating if the file is single or paired end. Let's explore the latest dataset I was working when I wrote this document: 

SRA_Code | Sequence_Tech | Cell_location_stage | Strain | Total_Sequences | Length | Source | ServerName
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
SRR8859642 | PAIR END | Procyclic | EATRO 1125 | 85,827,714 | 125/125 | Cooper2019_gRNA | Cooper2019_gRNA_E1125PC
SRR8859640 | PAIR END | Bloodstream | EATRO 1125 | 79,132,567 | 125/125 | Cooper2019_gRNA | Cooper2019_gRNA_E1125BS
SRR8859641 | PAIR END | Bloodstream + Procyclic MIX | EATRO 1125 | 148935513 | 125/125 | Cooper2019_gRNA | Cooper2019_gRNA_E1125Mix



## Codes repository

Selection of commented and finished codes in bash, awk, perl and R format, plus markdowns files explaining these codes using small toy datasets. Finally in this document you can also find useful one liners commented, also with toy examples. 

## Awk one-liners 




## Bash one-liners

* Save routinary codes as bash comands with my own label to called them on the terminal. To start what we need it's do edit the file `~/.bashrc` with favorite text editor [(guide for vim commands)](VIM/README.md)

Fucntions 
```
lsad() {
find $PWD -type f -iname $1
}
```

## Perl one-liners
