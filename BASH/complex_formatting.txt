1. The Arabidopsis F-box protein FBW2 degrades AGO1 to avoid spurious loading of illegitimate small RNA [PARE-seq]
(Submitter supplied) RNA silencing is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotes and is involved in development, heterochromatin maintenance and defense against viruses. In plants, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) protein plays a central role in both microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed silencing and its expression is regulated at multiple levels. Here we report that the F-box protein FBW2 targets proteolysis of AGO1 by a CDC48-mediated autophagy mechanism. more...
